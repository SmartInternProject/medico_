This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Above Folder Consists of Both Front-End and Back-End

- Front-End --> Except spring-data-jpa whole Files belongs to Front-End.
- Back-End --> spring-data-jpa.

## How to Run Application

1) To Run the Application Download the Code or Clone it.
2) After retriving the whole medico_ folder open the folder in VSCode.
3) Open Eclipse and import the spring-data-jpa using Existing Maven Project.
4) Run the Back-End Code before Executing the Front-End.


## Front-End Execution
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run build 
# or
npm run-script build

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Back-End Execution

Using Eclipse to run the program...
if the port no 8080 is in use go to application.properties and change server.properties = 8081(change to your custom port).
